# Getting Started

If you are new to nannou or Rust, you are in the right place!

In this section, we will:

1. Install the Rust programming language.
2. Check for platform-specific requirements.
3. Setup our code editor for working with Rust.
4. Run some nannou examples.
5. Make our own, new nannou project!

Let's get started.
