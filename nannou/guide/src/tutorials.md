# Tutorials

In the previous chapter we prepared everything needed to start our own Nannou
project! In this chapter, we will take a more focused look at all of the
different features we can add to our Nannou project.

If you are new to Nannou or Rust we recommend starting with the "Basics"
tutorials before going on. If you are feeling more confident, feel free to
choose your own adventure through the following tutorials depending on what you
want to add to your project!
